# Intelligent Parking Guidance System

The Intelligent Parking Guidance System is an innovative solution designed to enhance parking safety and efficiency using advanced sensor technology and smart signal processing. Developed and showcased at UIC's Engineering EXPO 2024, the system has been recognized with the Best in Show award for its effectiveness in managing blind spots and reducing parking lot accidents.

## Project Overview

The Intelligent Parking Spot System aims to transform parking experiences in commercial and residential areas by integrating ultrasonic sensors, cameras, and LED indicators to improve visibility and safety.

### Key Features

- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement**: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to accurately measure the distance to objects, aiding in precise parking.
- **LED Indicator Lights**: Includes a series of lights that change color based on the proximity of the vehicle to the parking spot:
  - **Green LED**: Indicates a vacant spot.
  - **Yellow LED**: Flashes when there is movement within the spot.
  - **Red LED**: Alerts when the spot is nearly or fully occupied.
- **Auditory Alarm System**: A buzzer activates to warn of potential collisions if an object is detected within 2 inches.
- **LCD Display**: Provides real-time feedback about parking status with messages like "OBJECT TOO CLOSE" or "PERFECT POSITION".

### Development Journey

- **Blind Spot Management System**: Extended version of the project presented at the UIC Innovation Spark Series Demo Day, receiving significant attention and constructive feedback from industry experts. Proudly ranked among the TOP 5 at the event, which underscores our commitment to innovation and practical safety solutions in parking management.
- **Feedback Integration**: Post-Demo Day enhancements include optimized scalability for larger parking facilities, improved data analytics for monitoring traffic patterns, and a streamlined sensor framework.


## Market Opportunity

The demand for reliable, scalable, and efficient parking solutions is increasingly evident, with over 40,000 parking garages in the U.S. alone facing challenges related to safety and space management. The Intelligent Parking Guidance System offers a compelling upgrade for these facilities by providing:
- **Enhanced Safety**: Reduces the risk of collisions and improves overall security in parking environments.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Ensures optimal usage of parking spaces and minimizes the time spent by drivers looking for available spots.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to different parking environments without the need for extensive infrastructural modifications.

## Acknowledgements

We extend our gratitude to the UIC Innovation team, our mentors, and all participants at the Demo Day for their invaluable insights and feedback.
Special thanks to my teammates Om Goyal and Syed Sufiyan Ahemd for their dedication and creativity throughout the project development.

## Future Directions

Building on the success at the UIC Engineering Expo and subsequent feedback, future developments will focus on:
- **Technological Advancements**: Integrating more sophisticated sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and automated management.
- **Expansion Plans**: Looking to partner with commercial and residentil complexes to implement and test our system on a larger scale.

Thank you to everyone who has supported and believed in the potential of the Intelligent Parking Guidance System. Here's to further innovation and making every parking experience safe and seamless!
